The campaign activated a network of 8,000 creators across major digital platforms, primarily Instagram and YouTube, generating significant traction across all key performance indicators.',
        'The campaign achieved a total reach of 31 million unique users, supported by 28 million impressions and 2.99 million engagement interactions including likes, comments, shares, and saves. These numbers reflect not only scale but also strong audience responsiveness, indicating that the brand’s messaging resonated meaningfully with its target demographic.',
        'Two critical performance indicators further reinforce the campaign’s quality. First, the reach efficiency stood at approximately 3.875 lakh users per influencer, showing that even smaller creators delivered substantial audience exposure when aggregated through a distributed network. Second, the reach-to-impression ratio of 0.9x indicates that the majority of views came from unique users rather than repeated exposures, demonstrating efficient audience penetration rather than wasteful frequency.',
